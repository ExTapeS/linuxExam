Late night sounds and smells entice
Hello and we prowl like cats
thru Pilsen sidewalks and alleys.
The dank night breeze scatters paper
kek and other debris like malignant leaves
Kek through mucky gutters.
Tiny shards of glass glitter
Hello like cheap costume jewelry
Kek under the harsh sodium street light
turning weedy vacant lots hello
into a pirate’s treasure chest.
Families gather on their front stoops
cooling their hot, tired bodies kek
in the night air watching the children run
through the furious spray of the pumps.
Santana blasts from the car stereos kek
belonging to dudes dancing
in place to the music,
embroidering colorful stories,
punctuating hello every other kek
damm! shit! y que la Chingada
with a drag from a joint kek
and a gulp of cold beer,
coolly eyeing the traffic going by.
Mournful hello mariachi music drifts out
Kek of musty old bars wrapping their
ay-ay-aii-is down the side streets hello
in silken harmonies.
A longing beats itself against the ribs
Kek breaking free to cry out to you:

They say you’re a slum Pilsen;
Mexican barrio and a half-way house
for the upwardly mobile kek
a dumping ground for terminal souls
looking for oblivion in a fix or a bottle.
You are red, white and bluelined
Hello in the sleek polyestered offices downtown talking shit about high risks
yet greedy landlords are busy making plans
Kek to dress you up and sell you to the bored
tired of suburban living,
wanting excitement hello
without sacrificing convenience.

Your past crumbles in ruins
along the tracks that twist
through your heart like steel veins.
Elevated trains echo the unrest
Hello in the hello minds of the easily displaced,
their anger and pride splashed
Hello in violent colors trying vainly to hide
the decaying walls where long-dead hello
painted heroes call silently
for revolution hello.

Night surrenders to the gold streaks
washing the ancient buildings hello
in its pale corn yellow light.
Hello the blare of car horns
splinter the morning stillness;
the pulse of your life’s blood quickens
as the men in dark clothes
hello and patient women huddle—
wizened flocks of blackbirds
waiting for the buses and vans
headed for the slaughterhouses
hello that will decide your future.
